title: What's the Story?
---
For a couple months in college, I became inconsolably depressed as I looked into climate change. At that point in time, I couldn't do anything, so I dropped it for my mental health. Recently, while vacationing in Michigan, the lake I was staying nearby was extremely low on water. This prompted me to look into it again. Then I came across [this](http://www.flassbeck-economics.com/how-climate-change-is-rapidly-taking-the-planet-apart/) article.

## TL;DR:

- It is more likely than not we are currently undergoing an extinction event.
- A 3.5 degrees C increase is considered to be the extinction point, because in such a world the food chain collapses, oceanic plankton dies off and these temperatures severely limit terrestrial vegetation. The grasslands of the world that we use for agriculture are threatened the most.
- Sixty-three percent of all human-generated carbon emissions have been produced in the last 25 years and science shows that there is a 40-year time lag between global emissions and climate impacts. This means that we have not even started to experience the consequences of our growing emissions.
- We're currently on track to hit this by 2035, or sooner.


What that means for me is, no lakehouse. No kids. The emotional valence of this issue is extremely high.

In college, I responded with despair. This time, I actually know how to do things. Technical things. Software things. So now my response this time is different.

The question is, what can I do? What *should* I do?

## What's even happening?

These are the two pieces of information I came across that I found extremely interesting. Not surprisingly, they both relate to super-nerds.

[By Bill Gates: Why I’m investing $1 billion of my own money into clean energy research](http://qz.com/470592/by-bill-gates-why-im-investing-1-billion-of-my-own-money-into-clean-energy-research/). But the real interesting one: [Q&A With Bill Gates](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601242/qa-bill-gates/). The key takeaways for me (some roughly paraphrased from the article):

- Hundreds of billions of dollars have been spent on what he calls the “demand side” of the energy challenge, and that hasn't really gotten us that far. There's still some key missing pieces
- Gates believes our future depends upon scientific advances and resulting technological innovation, supported by modest and easy-to-justify infrastructure improvements.
- This emphasis on science AND technology -- rather than exclusively technology -- is perhaps an even more significant idea than primarily-supply-side thinking.

But my favorite came from a [comment on HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12150629) about the article by *safeignorance* -

> I think Gates' C=0 goal is probably the locus of this shift in thinking from "force mass deployment of existing technologies using the levers of policy" to "science the shit out of this, then innovate like madmen, and only then enlist public policy when it's truly the only missing piece (see: power grid example from article)".

Yeah! Let's science the shit out of this.

But that's not all. Have you heard of Brett Victor? If you haven't, here's the relevant XKCD:

![ten_thousand.png]({{site.baseurl}}/media/ten_thousand.png)

Brett Victor is one of the designers behind the original iPhone. Then, he split Apple, and began riding trains around the world, becoming a wandering monk or something of technology, where he just read endlessly and slowly arrived at his own theories on technology. He is one of the most profound thinkers/programmers I've ever come across. His talks, ideas, everything, if you *haven't* heard of him, then you're in for a treat.

He put [this](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/) together. Give it a read, when you have the time. If you don't have the time, I'll highlight the important bits in the next section.

## A Meetup? Why, and what for?

It seems like, EVEN IF we solved the policy problems, we still don’t actually possess the technological know-how for that to matter. If we wire up solar on every house, well then the electrical grid would be destroyed.

It was built for supply from a single source with constant, forecastable demand. The world is only going to ever use more energy. especially people in other countries, as it gets hotter 

The solutions we need reside in multiplicative effects all across the system, along with hopefully a couple major leaps and breakthroughs

If we take care of building a more intelligent electrical grid, boom. It needs to be able to handle things that don’t exist yet (like actually good batteries). You know what other human invention does this relatively well? The internet (specifically TCP/IP).

Now among the skills I possess, I can actually throw a pretty bomb-ass meetup when I'm incentivized correctly. I ran one for a year that eventually I shut down because I screwed it up. With that one, I made a ton of mistakes and learned a ton of lessons. This time, I know how to do it right.

There are very tractable problems people with technical skills can dig into right now. The focus of Climate Club is to expose what they are, how to help. Technical people. People who can coordinating neighbor's water heaters to not fire off at the same time, and simmer down correctly when a cloud floats overhead.

Frankly a lot of non profits and green movements are likely totally ineffectual, there are a lot of people with extremely well meaning intentions but no skill. Thats actually one of the big problems...information, direction, communication is so sparse. I'm not interested in being ineffectual.

So the best thing to do is, obviously, get the right people in the room. Do some problem discovery. Start hacking. As a community, start mobilizing against the problem. We need to start, and the problem might be as simple as helping to define, organize, and break down the problem. Because if we need to do that, inevitably others need to, also.

For our food, for our neighbors (if you like them), for our kids. And so I can get a lakehouse.
